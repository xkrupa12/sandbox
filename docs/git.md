### Partial commits
It seems to be a good practice to commit changes grouped together by the logical parts rather than the whole bunch together - smaller commits in a particular order might "tell a story" of what happened

### Issue Resolution
When a commit resolves issue, commit message should contain information about what issue was resolved. Example: `Solved this serious problem - resolves #55`
